# LooSounds
A therapeutical soundboard for fighting deppression.
"If you ever find yourself taking life too seriously whip out this app. You're guaranteed to feel better after a few taps."

LooSounds is my first whack at Android development. A very humble app with rudimentary soundboard functionality, mainly done to explore custom button/layout designs and such.
